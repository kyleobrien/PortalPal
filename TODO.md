# TODO

## Refactoring

-   Finish cleaning up repository, including:
    1.  Handling for any calls that can throw.
    1.  Adding JSDOC support.
-   Consider getting list of Portals into PortalPalPlayer class.
-   Rename "you" property on Player to something better.
-   Colors in properties menu are manually specified. Probably a better way.
-   Clean up js files that are no longer used.
