# TODO

As best as possible, these should also e tracked in TODO comments.

-   Improve the playing of the teleportation sound so that it plays for everyone in the vicinity (outgoing and incoming).

--------------

-   Change to always show current players as well as those who are offline, ut have saved portals.
-   I probably need some state management for the menu being displayed so I can handle "back" type of workflows.
-   Assets:
    -   Icons for all the buttons.
    -   Better PortalPal texture.
    -   Better behavior and texture pack artwork.
-   Do I need to escape characters going into the json?
-   Code review and clean up.
-   Maybe get better success and failure sounds?
-   Add JSDoc support to everything.
