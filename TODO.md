# TODO

General things that aren't tracked in TODO comments.

-   Change to always show current players as well as those who are offline, ut have saved portals.
-   I probably need some state management for the menu being displayed so I can handle "back" type of workflows.
-   Assets:
    -   Icons for all the buttons.
    -   Better PortalPal texture.
    -   Better behavior and texture pack artwork.
-   Fix the sound so that it plays for everyone in the vicinity of the teleport (outgoing and incoming).
