# TODO

General things that aren't tracked in TODO comments.

// TODO: Need to decide on an icon for each type of player.

Copy and pasted from somewhere...

/*  TODO:
 *  Final item texture.
 *  Final behavior and texture pack artwork.
 *  See about upgrading manifest versions so we don't need to turn on experimental stuff?
 */

// Adding to this test.
