# TODO

## Refactoring

-   Finish cleaning up repository, including:
    1.  Adding JSDOC support.
-   Consider getting list of Portals into PortalPalPlayer class.
-   Colors in properties menu are manually specified. Probably a better way.
-   Clean up js files that are no longer used.

## Enhancements

-   Don't teleport right on top of a person, but the nearest open spot around them that is safe.
    -   "Safe" is not easily defined.
-   Allow teleporting to portals belonging to players that are not in the game.
-   Improve the playing of the teleportation sound so that it plays for everyone in the vicinity (outgoing and incoming).

## Other

-   Lint the code.
-   Add to the README:
    -   Take some screenshots.
